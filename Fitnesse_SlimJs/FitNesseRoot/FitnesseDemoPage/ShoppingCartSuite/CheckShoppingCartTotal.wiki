The cart total should be displayed using the normal way that people in the US display cart totals:


!|script                   |Generic Web Script                             |
|Go To                     |http://localhost:4200/cart                     |
|Wait Until Element With Id|cart-total    |Is Located, Or|2000|Ms Have Past|
|Check                     |Get Text By Id|cart-total    |$6.46            |
|Done                                                                      |
